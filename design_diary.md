Dear diary,
    This assignment has to be the shortest one we've had so far.
    I managed to get it done in under three hours. With having
    the base code for the UI calculator and some base code
    for the python running Pyside2 I was able to fit in
    the rest of the code like a jigsaw puzzle. I think
    the most complex part of this was figuring out
    how to use the accumulator and explode the
    first term, operation and second term. I'm
    sure there is a way to calculate a string
    such as existing libraries, or using regular
    expressions or I can simply code my own novice
    for-loop that takes the first term as a total,
    takes the next operator and performs the
    arithmetic for total and next term, iteratively.
    I learned that if I did my own iterative function it 
    would then need another layer such as order of operation.
    At first i wrote it only expecting a number, operation and another
    number, and if there are too many then it will
    give an error. One approach that failed was
    putting a length checker like 3 but this assumes
    the numbers are single digit so that was a dead end.
    Another approach is to split the string via operators.
    But if I split by operators then I lose the operators
    because I cannot have operators as delimiters.
    Instead I am using a built in function called eval().
    I might update the code and the diary later.
    I do plan to look up some quick video tutorials 
    to prep me for the bigger QT assignment.
